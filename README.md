# Copernicus - The Solar System
This is the playground with which I won the WWDC18 Scolarship. With this playground I wanted to combine Astronomy with Coding, with, of course, the help of Nicolaus Copernicus. It guides the users to the creation of the Solar System throught the Augmented Reality. 

## What do you need?
You need two things: 
- An *iPad Pro* or an *iPad 5th and above*
- Playground Book installed on it

### How to start it?
Use AirDrop to send the project folder to iPad or drag and drop it in the Playgrounds' folder on iCloud Drive.
